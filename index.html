			<h3>Protests in China, The Update</h3>
			<h4>By Isabelle Rosa</h4>
			<h5>Published September 5, 2019</h5>

			<p>The current update on the protests in China is that Carrie Lam, Chief Executive of Hong Kong, officially <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/world/asia/hong-kong-carrie-lam-protests.html" target="_blank">withdrew the Extradition Bill</a> on September 4th.</p>

			<p>You may be asking yourself wait didn’t she already do something about the extradition bill? The answer is that she previously suspended the bill and said that it was “dead”.</p>

			<p>How does this relate to the protests in Hong Kong?</p>

			<p>The protests are in reaction to a bill released, “that would allow people accused of crimes to be sent to places with which Hong Kong had no extradition treaty - including mainland China, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/08/world/asia/hong-kong-protests-explained.html" target="_blank">courts are controlled by the Communist Party</a>."
			</p>

			<p>First, how rude. Second, where did this go from here.</p>

			<p>The protests were in response to this bill, but have and will continue in response to police brutality. These protests are peaceful marches and sit ins. The vast majority of participants are nonviolent, but some protestors have broken into buildings, defaced government property, set fires and had run ins with police.</p>

			<p>While the protests started in response to the extradition bill, protestors are also fighting for democracy, freedom, amnesty for arrested protestors, and <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/05/world/asia/carrie-lam-hong-kong-protests.html" target="_blank">independent inquiry into police conduct</a>. The protests will continue until there is justice.</p>

			<h3>The 2020 Democratic Primary, Where Are We Now</h3>
			<h4>By Isabelle Rosa</h4>
			<h5>Published September 5, 2019</h5>

			<img src="https://media1.s-nbcnews.com/j/newscms/2019_35/2988376/190828-debate-candidates-collage-cs-313p_bce9d406acc809832e21b22781b88d01.fit-1240w.jpg" alt="Pictured, the ten qualifying candidates for the September 12th debate">

		<div>
			<p>With the third Democratic Presidential Debate Approaching on September 12th, <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/08/29/us/politics/next-democratic-debate-candidates.html?rref=collection%2Fnewseventcollection%2Fdemocratic-debates&action=click&contentCollection=politics&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=2&pgtype=collection" target="_blank">10 candidates met the qualification requirements</a>.</p>

			<p>Looking at this list of 10, it is clear that the candidates who made the cut, are the ones who have received the most media coverage and had the most striking moments in past debates.</p>

			<p>Moving forward, don’t listen to big media outlets on who to follow, don’t listen to this publication or any other, don’t listen to the tweets or Instagram posts you see. Listen to yourself, your own opinions, what you think is important, what you want from a president, and what you want them to focus on.</p>

			<h4><u>Female candidates still in the game:</u></h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Senator Kamala Harris of California</li> 
				<li>Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota</li> 
				<li>Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts</li>
			</ul>

			<h4><u>Candidates actually prioritizing climate change:</u></h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Nearly all of the candidates call for rejoining the <a href="https://unfccc.int/process-and-meetings/the-paris-agreement/the-paris-agreement" target="_blank">Paris climate change agreement</a>.</li>
				<li>Senator Elizabeth Warren, Former Vice President Joe Biden, Senator Kamala Harris, and Mayor Pete Buttigieg all <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/04/us/politics/democrats-climate-change-plans.html?rref=collection%2Fnewseventcollection%2F2020-election&action=click&contentCollection=politics&region=rank&module=package&version=highlights&contentPlacement=1&pgtype=collection" target= "_blank">support the carbon tax</a> and have outlined plans that include the carbon tax.</li>
			</ul>

			<h4><u>Candidates who care about gun control:</u></h4>
			<ul>
				<li>Biden believes the only <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/02/us/politics/democratic-candidates-iowa-new-hampshire.html" target="_blank">solution for major gun control legislation</a> is to defeat Republicans in elections.</li>
				<li>Warren claims she will reduce overall gun deaths by 80% and wants to address gun control in a broader way, in regards to public health, not just with legislation.</li>
				<li>Sanders called for background checks and an assault weapons ban.</li>
				<li>Klobuchar said background checks were “the minimum that we should do.”</li>
			</ul>

			<p>Vote. Vote. Vote. It is not only your right, but it is your duty to make your voice heard. Dive deep into what you want for our future, what you can do to achieve that, and who you can put that trust in.</p>

			<h3>The Imminent Impeachment of Brett Kavanaugh</h3>
			<h4>By Isabelle Rosa</h4>
			<h5>Published September 15, 2019</h5>

			<img src="https://www.motherjones.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/09/091419apkav.jpg?w=990" alt="Pictured, Brett Kavanaugh during his confirmation hearing September 4, 2018">

		<div>
			<p>On Saturday, September 14th, the New York Times <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/14/sunday-review/brett-kavanaugh-deborah-ramirez-yale.html?action=click&module=RelatedLinks&pgtype=Article" target="_blank">published an essay</a> in the Opinion section regarding allegations of sexual misconduct against Brett Kavanaugh.</p>

			<p>Kavanaugh, now a Supreme Court Justice, was accused of sexual assault by Christine Blasey Ford, which became the focus of his conformation hearing. The allegations made by Deborah Ramirez, however, were not investigated as heavily and pushed to the side.</p>

			<p>With the release of this essay, many of the potential democratic candidates are calling for <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2019/09/15/us/brett-kavanaugh-allegations-trump-impeach.html" target="_blank">the impeachment of Kavanaugh</a>.  Those calling for impeachment include Elizabeth Warren, Kamala Harris, Julián Castro, and Bernie Sanders.</p>

			<p>Trump, who nominated and appointed the Supreme Court Justice, in 2018 is defending Kavanaugh and even suggesting that he sue the accusers of seditious libel.</p>
