			<h1>About me</h1>
	
			<p>Hi, my name is Isabelle Rosa. I am currently a sophomore at the New School majoring in Journalism and Design. I am from a small beach town in New Jersey. I now live in New York, so still close to home. My interests include fashion, interior design, sustainability, photography, and the outdoors. I am very passionate about music. My taste is R&B, modern jazz, indie alternative, and rap. More things about me, I am a cancer sun, moon, and rising. I know, very unusual. Currently, I am enjoying life, looking forward to the future, and taking everything one step at a time.</p>
